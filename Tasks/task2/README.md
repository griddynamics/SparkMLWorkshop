# Task 2. Clustering model. The definition of a private university or not.

## Description

The folder `data/university/` contains university data.
It will be necessary to cluster these universities into private and non-private.
It will be necessary to build a clustering model using clustering algorithm from the Spark ML library.

## Data

The folder `data/university/` contains university data (`train.csv`).
The `Private` column was cut from the data set.
This column is located in the file `is_private.csv`.

The data contains the following fields:

## Task

The task is to train a machine learning clustering model that will split university into 2 clusters (private and not private).

Conditions:
* Model should be trained only using Spark ML clustering algorithm.
* You need to train the model on a training data set `train.csv`.
* Calculate metrics based on the file `is_private.csv`.
